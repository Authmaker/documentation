#### Start your application

To start your backend application locally, run `npm start` in your backend directory. PM2 will keep the server running for us. Then switch to your frontend Ember application directory and run `ember server` to start your Ember app. 

#### Create a user and login

Clicking on the login button will redirect you to an Authmaker page allowing you to sign up or login. You can create your first user and interact with your application.
