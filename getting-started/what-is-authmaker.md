title: What is Authmaker?
---

#### NOTE: This is all rough idea outlines!! WIP

Authmaker is a platform for easily adding authentication and payment processing in your Ember app.

It started with a simple question...

What does a fullstack solution as efficient and easy as Ember look like?

Could we build a platform that provides simple tools for building a custom backend application with secure authentication and payment processing?

Could we make it so user-friendly that you could launch your app in as little as 3 days?

#### The platform


#### Opinionated authentication

You shouldn't need to be a security expert to implement a secure login and payment system for your app. Authmaker lets you focus on **your app**, not authentication. Authmaker's opinionated curriculum provides you with a fullstack solution that _works_ - no messy configuration, no treacherous learning curve.

#### The curriculum

#### Easy to use

New to backend development? No problem! Authmaker was designed to be an inclusive platform. While basic familiarity with Javascript and Ember _is_ recommended, our mission is to make fullstack development straightforward, painless, and productive.

Consider yourself a backend whiz? Authmaker....., without the boring boilerplate config.

So you've got an idea for an app. Get your app launched faster with Authmaker.
